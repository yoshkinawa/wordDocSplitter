# wordDocSplitter
This is a word vba code that takes a word document and split it's sections into different word documents, keeping all the styles.

notes:
1. I suppose to keep all the original styles.
2. insert the destination folder name instead of "path\to\folder"
3. For some reason the style "Normal" needed a different treatment to keep it style on the output document.
4. The is a part of the code that stips all the hyperlinks. If you want to keep them put it under a comment.
5. TIP: use chatGPT to tweak the code
